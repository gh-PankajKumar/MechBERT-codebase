The strength and ductility were greatly improved after cold rolling (CR) or ECAP processing compared with that of as-cast alloy, but the strength still cannot meet the requirement of orthopedic implant materials.

"According to the tensile test results (), compared with room temperature, the yield strength at higher temperature(650 ℃ and 750 ℃) decreased slightly, even from 650 °C to 750 °C, the yield strength of the alloy decreased from 1034 MPa to 1006 MPa with a reduction of no more than 5%. It is considered that multi-sized and uniformly distributed spherical γ′ phases (a-b) have a strong hindrance to the movement of dislocations, thereby significantly improving the tensile mechanical properties of the sample. Moreover, the strength of the γ′ phase increases with temperature , so the decrease in the yield strength of the γ matrix phase can be compensated by the increase in the strength of the γ′ phase, resulting in little change in the yield strength of the grain-size gradient nickel-based superalloy. However, the ultimate tensile strength of the superalloy decreased sharply from 1635 MPa to 1190 MPa when the test temperature increased from room temperature to 750 °C, and even decreased by 15% from 650 °C to 750 °C. This is because dislocations tangle and lock each other at room temperature, which hinders the movement of dislocations and leads to a higher tensile strength compared to the high temperature. When the test temperature rises above 650 °C, the γ′ phase softens under the repeated cutting of dislocations, stacking faults or micro-twins, and the hindrance to the motion of dislocations reduces. Meanwhile, the slip mode of the dislocation changes to the cross-slip mode, which promotes plastic deformation, leading to a decrease in tensile strength and an improvement in plasticity .",What was the decrease in yield strength of the alloy from 650 °C to 750 °C?,1034 MPa to 1006 MPa,247

"Al-alloys are workhorse materials for structural applications due to their high specific strength. Among them, cast Al- alloys such as Al-Si alloys have specific importance to readily develop cast structures. Silicon is added to aluminium to lower the melting point and increase fluidity. With aluminium, silicon alone results in an alloy that cannot be heat treated; when magnesium is combined with aluminium and silicon it yields an alloy that can be heat treated and precipitation hardens. Casting production frequently employs silicon addition to aluminium. The yield and tensile strength of Al-Si alloys improve as Si content rises to 13% and starts decreasing beyond this level. However, percentage elongation continues to fall as silicon content rises at all levels; two of the most widely used aluminium alloys are A356 (Al-7Si-0.35Mg) and A357 (Al-7Si-0.55Mg), which are both die-cast and belong to the elementary grades. This silumin offers excellent casting properties, but its specific strength does not exceed the level of the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) ≤ 360 MPa, yield strength (YS) ≤ 300 MPa, and elongation ≤ 10%. LM25 is a cast Al-Si alloy, having 6.5 – 7.5% Si and 0.2 – 0.6% Mg, is being used for marine applications. This alloy shows tensile strength around 250 MPa, whereas the demand in strength for intended application is more than 350 MPa, without affecting its ductility.",What is LM25?,"a cast Al-Si alloy, having 6.5 – 7.5% Si and 0.2 – 0.6% Mg",1144

"The 2195 Al-Cu-Li alloy is widely utilized in the aerospace industry due to its lightweight nature and high strength. Consequently, gaining a comprehensive understanding of techniques to enhance its microstructural and mechanical properties is crucial for the consistent production of reliable and high-strength aerospace components. In this investigation, a pristine 2195 industrial ingot was subject to three distinct forging pretreatments: PT1, which involved a direct three upsetting and three stretching (3U3S) process; PT2, which combined double stage homogenization (DH) with 3U3S; and PT3, which involved DH along with six upsetting and six stretching (6U6S). Subsequent warm deformation and T8 aging treatment were applied to the pretreated forgings. The microstructure evolution during the processes and the final mechanical properties in three orthogonal dimensions were examined. The findings revealed that the combination of DH and multi-dimensional forging (MDF) facilitated the dissolution of non-equilibrium phases to a greater extent. Consequently, the main strengthening phase transformed from the T1 + δ` phase observed in PT1 to the denser T1 + little θ` phase observed in PT2 and PT3 after T8 aging treatment. Notably, the tensile strength and yield strength of PT2 and PT3 specimens increased by 20–30 MPa in all three directions. Moreover, the MDF process accelerated the recrystallization behavior from PT1 to PT3, resulting in a gradual reduction in the average grain size of the pretreated samples from 356 µm to 186 µm. Following warm forging and T8 aging, the grains exhibited a finer and equiaxed structure. Additionally, the coarse phase was identified as the primary source of transgranular cracking. The coarse phases within the matrix became more homogeneous and finer from PT1 to PT3, with a gradual decrease in their area fraction. On the fracture surfaces, the aggregation of coarse phases diminished.",What industry is the 2195 Al-Cu-Li alloy utilized in?,aerospace industry,50

"Therefore, the strength-ductility balance of titanium alloy can be obtained by controlling the microstructure with an appropriate heat treatment procedure . The related studies have been carried out recently. Fan et al. found that Ti-7333 had an ultrahigh tensile strength (over 1400 MPa) and a reasonable ductility (over 10 % in elongation) after solution treatment at 820 °C for 50 min and an aging treatment at 520 °C/540 °C for 6 h. Zhang et al. reported that the αs of the Ti-5Al-5Mo-5V-3Cr-0.6Fe alloys was visibly refined after solution treatment followed by two-step aging, which could significantly increase the strength, while the elongation decreases slightly. Zhang et al. found that the fine secondary αs and the small inter-particle spacing of αs were formed by ω-assisted nucleation in Ti-6532 titanium alloy after aging at 500 ℃. With the increase of aging temperature, the size of αs and the inter-particle spacing of αs increased, and the α/β grain boundary decreased. Moreover, some studies have also claimed that the multi-scale microstructure can improve ductility with a slight reduction in strength by compatible deformation. Above all, the strength of titanium alloys is mainly related to the acicular secondary αs, which is the most sensitive to aging temperature. Therefore, it is of great significance to systematically study the effect of aging temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties of titanium alloys.",What was the tensile strength of Ti-7333?,over 1400 MPa,287

"To simultaneously improve the strength and ductility of the Mg-10Gd-3Y alloy, we propose a new processing route: conventional extrusion (EX), followed by an equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) deformation, without stopping.

The extra shearing deformation by the ECAP-stage of the ES testing led to the formation of a fully recrystallized homogenous microstructure with an average grain size of 4.3 µm, with dynamic precipitation of Mg5(Gd,Y) particles at/near grain boundaries. Both macro and micro texture characterizations indicated a strong decrease in the intensity of the crystallographic texture during the ECAP part of the ES process, and a new type of texture.

"Besides, the cheap Sm element was also attracted considerable attention due to the reasonable maximum solid solubility (∼ 5.8 wt%) in Mg matrix. Accordingly, Guan et al. reported that the addition of 3.5 wt% Sm can improve the strength of Mg-0.5Zn-0.5Zr wt% alloy up to 368 MPa. The significant grain refinement and the nano-precipitation together contribute to the high strength. Recently, Zhang et al. developed a new Mg-4Sm-2Yb-0.6Zn-0.4Zr alloy, which can exhibit a YS of 130 MPa and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 235 MPa. The low-alloyed Mg-Sm based alloy above can also exhibit high YS of ∼ 115 MPa at high temperature of ∼ 250 °C.",What UTS can Mg-4Sm-2Yb-0.6Zn-0.4Zr alloy exhibit?,235 MPa,534
